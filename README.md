# Web Photo Frame

A frontend-only (Vanilla JS) app used for devices that are in a "photo frame" mode.

I had initially built Veezy (iOS/iPad app that was sold) for this purpose.

## Development

`serve -s .`

## Production

Just push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## TODOs

- [ ] Figure out a way to load & show Live photos.
