# Web Photo Frame

A frontend-only (Vanilla JS) app used for devices that are in a "photo frame" mode.

I had initially built [Veezy]() (iOS/iPad) for this purpose, but prefer a web app.

Uses [Deno](https://deno.land) as a backend (though you could just serve the `src` directory with any other tool).

Deploy by pushing to the `main` branch.

View locally using `make start`.
