# Web Photo Frame

A frontend-only (Vanilla JS) app used for devices that are in a "photo frame" mode.

I had initially built [Veezy](https://github.com/BrunoBernardino/Veezy-iOS) (iOS/iPad) for this purpose, but prefer a web app.

## Development

View locally using `deno run --allow-net --allow-read https://deno.land/std@0.197.0/http/file_server.ts src` or `npx servo src`.

## Deployment

Just push to the `main` branch.
